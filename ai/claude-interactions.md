# Claude Interactions Log

## Session 2025-06-14 15:50

**Interaction 1** - 15:50  
**Tokens**: ~2000 input, ~500 output  
**Summary**: Initial project setup for Freud of the Dark (FOTD) game. Created CLAUDE.md with guidance from temperature-monitor project. User wants to develop browser-based story-driven game with Xbox controller support, focusing on psychologist protagonist counseling fantastical creatures in relationships.

**Next Steps**: Develop detailed project plan through Q&A session with user to determine technical stack, game mechanics, and design considerations.

**Interaction 2** - 15:52  
**Tokens**: ~500 input, ~800 output  

**Interaction 3** - 15:54  
**Tokens**: ~200 input, ~400 output

**Interaction 4** - 15:56  
**Tokens**: ~350 input, ~300 output

**Interaction 5** - 15:58  
**Tokens**: ~500 input, ~400 output

**Interaction 6** - 16:00  
**Tokens**: ~350 input, ~350 output

## Session Summary - 2025-06-14
**Total Interactions**: 6  
**Total Tokens**: ~4150 input, ~2850 output  
**Key Decisions Made**:
- Framework: Phaser.js chosen for controller support and scene management
- Core loop: Exploration (no time pressure) → Memory recovery → Therapy sessions (interaction-limited) → Review/notes
- Progression: Player skill-based, not character stats
- Session mechanics: 5-10 min real time, health degradation system, comprehensive patient folders
- Narrative: Memory loss therapist helping fantastical creatures, childhood backstory
**Deliverables**: Created DESIGN.md with complete game specification
**Next Steps**: Technical implementation, proof of concept development

## Session Summary - 2025-06-14 (Complete)
**Total Interactions**: 12  
**Total Tokens**: ~4600 input, ~4150 output  

**Major Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Created complete game design document (DESIGN.md)
- ✅ Built working Phaser.js proof of concept with 5 scenes
- ✅ Implemented basic controller support (partial)
- ✅ Created patient files system with health meters
- ✅ Built therapy session mechanics with interaction counting
- ✅ Established project structure with package.json

**Current Status**: 
- Game loads and runs successfully
- Mouse navigation works perfectly
- D-pad controller navigation works
- **BLOCKING ISSUES**: A button and thumbstick detection inconsistent
- B button causes scene transition errors ("null is not an object evaluating n.cut")

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- Framework: Phaser.js for controller support and 2D game features
- Architecture: Scene-based with MainMenu → Office → PatientFiles/Sessions → Review
- Input: Global timing system (300ms delay) to prevent double inputs
- Art: Placeholder colored shapes, awaiting 100x100px character sprites
- Save system: Not yet implemented

**Next Session Priorities**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix Xbox controller A button and thumbstick detection
2. **CRITICAL**: Resolve B button scene transition errors
3. Add image assets (therapist, dragon, human characters)
4. Implement proper dialogue tree system
5. Add world exploration mechanics
6. Build memory recovery/flashback system

**Files Created**:
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Development guidance with logging requirements  
- `/DESIGN.md` - Complete game specification
- `/package.json` - Project dependencies (Phaser.js, http-server)
- `/index.html` - Game launcher
- `/src/game.js` - Main game code (5 scenes, controller input)
- `/ai/claude-interactions.md` - This session log

**Development Environment**: 
- Local server: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:8080)
- Controller: Xbox Wireless Controller confirmed connected
- Browser: Working with Phaser 3.70.0 via CDN

## Session 2025-06-15 09:45

**Interaction 1** - 09:45  
**Tokens**: ~400 input, ~500 output  
**Summary**: User requested analysis of TypeError involving `notesOverlay.setStroke` method. Located `openNotesInterface` method at line 1565 in `/Users/marklusby/Code/FOTD/src/game.js` where `notesOverlay` is created as `this.add.rectangle()` on line 1569, and `setStroke()` is called on line 1570. The issue is that `this.add.rectangle()` returns a Phaser Rectangle GameObject which should support `setStroke()` method. Analysis complete.

**Interaction 2** - 15:30  
**Tokens**: ~200 input, ~800 output  
**Summary**: User requested location of `startTypewriterEffect` method in TherapySessionScene and identification of where dialogue text is cleared. Found method at line 1811 that currently uses old dialogue box system (`this.dialogueText.setText()`), but `this.dialogueText` is never created in scene. Method needs updating to create dialogue bubbles above speaking characters instead. Current implementation has dialogue bubble properties initialized as null at lines 1354-1355 but never used.
